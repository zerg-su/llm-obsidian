TABLE type, status, updated FROM "wiki" SORT updated DESC LIMIT 15
```

### Seed Pages (Need Development)

```dataview
LIST FROM "wiki" WHERE status = "seed" SORT updated ASC
```

### Entities Missing Sources

```dataview
LIST FROM "wiki/entities" WHERE !sources OR length(sources) = 0
```

### Open Questions

```dataview
LIST FROM "wiki/questions" WHERE status = "developing" OR status = "seed" SORT updated DESC
```
